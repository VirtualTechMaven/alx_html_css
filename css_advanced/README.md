##Overview
**Smile School** is a static landing page designed to promote an online learning platform focused on smiles, laughter, and positivity.  
The goal of this project was to recreate the Figma layout with accurate positioning, typography, and color styling while ensuring code readability and maintainability.

The website includes several sections, from a hero banner to testimonials, all styled consistently and semantically structured.



## Features
Here’s what the landing page includes:
- A clean navigation bar with a centered logo and links.
- A hero section with a background image, large bold “Get Schooled” heading, and a call-to-action button.
- A Learn from the Pros section showcasing professional instructors.
- A testimonial block with image and quote styling.
- A tutorials section featuring multiple cards with thumbnail images, ratings, and duration.
- A membership section listing different membership tiers.
- A FAQ section to answer user questions.
- A footer with social media icons and credits.

Each section was styled to closely match the Figma design provided.

##  Design Reference
This layout was inspired by the **Smile School design on Figma**, featuring:
- Bold typography for headings (`Get Schooled`)
- White text overlaying a full-width background image
- Rounded elements and soft spacing for a friendly, modern feel
- Blue and white color palette for contrast and clarity


##  Technologies Used
- HTML5 — for semantic page structure  
- CSS3 — for styling and layout (linked via external stylesheet)  
- VS Code — for code editing  
- Git & GitHub — for version control and repository management

##Challenges & Learnings

During development, I learned:

How to structure complex layouts using HTML5 semantic tags.

How to manage spacing, hierarchy, and alignment using CSS.

The importance of consistent typography and color contrast.

How to properly link external stylesheets and assets.

Git version control basics (staging, committing, and pushing to GitHub).



##Future Improvements

Some enhancements I plan to make:

Make the page fully responsive for mobile and tablet.

Add hover animations to buttons and cards.

Implement a contact form for user sign-up.

Optimize images for faster loading.

Possibly rebuild with TailwindCSS or Bootstrap for practice.
